Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), and TypeScript supports this concept well. It involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. Additionally, encapsulation restricts direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components, which is crucial for preventing unintended interference and misuse.

Key Concepts of Encapsulation in TypeScript
---------------------------------------------
Access Modifiers: TypeScript provides three access modifiers to control access to class members:

----------public: ----------------
Members are accessible from anywhere.
 -------- private:---------
 Members are accessible only within the class itself.
----------protected:------------
 Members are accessible within the class and by subclasses.

----------Getters and Setters:------- 
These are special methods to access and modify private or protected properties. They provide a controlled way to interact with the properties of a class.

Benefits of Encapsulation
----------------------------

Control: You can control how data is accessed and modified.
Flexibility and Maintenance: Changes to the implementation can be made without affecting external code that uses the class.
Increased Security: Sensitive data can be hidden from the outside world.
